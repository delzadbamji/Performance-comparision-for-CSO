# Performance-comparision-for-CSO
Here, we compare the CSO algorithm over many variants of meta Heuristic algorithms.

The variants considered, fall under the umbrella of:
 - Gradient-Based Algorithms
 
    - SA  
 
 - Genetic/Evolutionary-Based Algorithms
 
    - DE

 - Swarm-Based Algorithms
    - PSO
    - FA
    - BA(Bat) 

A few of the Algorithms aren't posted, but can be displayed on request.

## Conclusion:
Keeping the No free lunch aside, CSO may perform well compared to [1], erratic with [2], and is dishonorable defeated by most of the algorithms in [3].
